      description: |
        The personal access token is meant to be used as an alternative to basic-auth when accessing Konnect via APIs.
        You can generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the [personal access token page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/tokens/) in the Konnect dashboard.
        The PAT token must be passed in the header of a request, for example:
         `curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header 'Authorization: Bearer kpat_xgfT...'`
    systemAccountAccessToken:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: Token
      description: |
        The system account access token is meant for automations and integrations that are not directly associated with a human identity.
        You can generate a system account Access Token by creating a system account and then obtaining a system account access token for that account.
        The access token must be passed in the header of a request, for example:
         `curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header 'Authorization: Bearer spat_i2Ej...'`
